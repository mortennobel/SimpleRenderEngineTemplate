The goal of SimpleRenderEngine (sre) is to provide easy way to get started with graphics 
programming in 2D or 3D without a deep knowledge about the low-level graphics APIs like 
OpenGL, DirectX and Vulkan.

## Getting started

First fork and clone the library (`git clone --recurse-submodules <url>`). 

Modify the code in the src folder.
